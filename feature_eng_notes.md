The features created in this notebook are designed to capture different aspects of user behavior, product popularity, and the interaction between users and products. These features are crucial for building a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a user will reorder a specific product in their next order. Let's break down the intuition behind each set of features:

### 1. **User-Level Features**
These features capture the overall behavior of each user:

- **Total number of orders placed by each user (`u_num_of_orders`)**: This indicates how active a user is. Users with more orders might have different reordering patterns compared to users with fewer orders.
  
- **Average number of products bought in each order (`u_avg_prd`)**: This gives an idea of the average basket size for each user. Users who buy more products per order might have different reordering behaviors.

- **Day of the week the user orders the most (`dow_u_most_orders`)**: This captures the preferred shopping day of the user, which might influence their reordering patterns.

- **Hour of the day the user places most of their orders (`hod_u_most_orders`)**: This captures the preferred shopping time of the user, which might also influence their reordering patterns.

- **Reorder ratio of each user (`u_reorder_ratio`)**: This indicates how frequently a user reorders products in general. A high reorder ratio suggests that the user is likely to reorder products.

- **Average days between orders (`average_days_between_orders`)**: This captures the typical interval between orders for a user. Users with shorter intervals might reorder more frequently.

- **Total items bought by user (`u_total_items_bought`)**: This indicates the total volume of products a user has purchased, which might correlate with their likelihood to reorder.

### 2. **Product-Level Features**
These features capture the overall popularity and reordering behavior of each product:

- **Number of times the product has been purchased by users (`p_num_of_times`)**: This indicates the overall popularity of the product. Popular products are more likely to be reordered.

- **Reorder ratio of each product (`p_reorder_ratio`)**: This indicates how frequently the product is reordered by all users. A high reorder ratio suggests that the product is often repurchased.

- **Average add to cart order for each product (`p_avg_cart_position`)**: This captures the typical position of the product in the shopping cart. Products added earlier in the cart might be more essential and thus more likely to be reordered.

### 3. **User-Product Interaction Features**
These features capture the specific interaction between each user and each product:

- **How many times a user has bought a product (`uxp_times_bought`)**: This indicates how frequently a specific user has bought a specific product. A higher count suggests a higher likelihood of reordering.

- **Reorder ratio for each user-product combination (`uxp_reorder_ratio`)**: This indicates how frequently a specific user reorders a specific product relative to their total orders. A high ratio suggests a strong preference for the product.

- **How many times a user bought a product in their last 5 orders (`uxp_last_five`)**: This captures recent behavior. If a user has bought a product frequently in their recent orders, they are more likely to reorder it.

- **Ratio of the products bought in the last 5 orders (`uxp_ratio_last_five`)**: This is a normalized version of the previous feature, providing a ratio of how many times the product was bought in the last 5 orders.

### 4. **Additional Features**
- **Aisle and Department Information**: These categorical features are mean-encoded to capture the likelihood of reordering based on the product's category. For example, products in certain aisles or departments might be more frequently reordered.

### Intuition Behind Feature Creation
The intuition behind creating these features is to capture different dimensions of user behavior, product popularity, and the specific interaction between users and products. By combining these features, the model can learn patterns such as:
- **User Habits**: How often a user shops, their preferred shopping times, and their general reordering behavior.
- **Product Popularity**: How popular a product is overall and how frequently it is reordered by all users.
- **User-Product Interaction**: How frequently a specific user buys a specific product and how recently they have bought it.

These features help the model to predict whether a user will reorder a specific product by understanding both the user's general behavior and their specific interaction with the product. The combination of these features provides a comprehensive view that can improve the accuracy of the predictions.
